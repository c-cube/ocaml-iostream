# Iostream

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-iostream/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-iostream/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This library defines _generic_ I/O streams of bytes. The streams should be
composable, user-definable, and agnostic to the underlying I/O mechanism; with
OCaml 5 it means that they might be backed by an effect-based scheduler.
